I’m a postdoctoral researcher (Postdoktoral forskare) at Uppsala University working on functinal materials design and discovery. My current research involves using data science and machine learning to solve problems in materials science.

In early 2019, I joined Uppsala University to conduct my Ph.D. collaborative research, where I was focused on the discovery and analysis of energy materials using first principles calculations. My research spans a broad range of energy related applications, including energy Conversion & Storage , photo-catalysis (HER & OER), thermoelectric, solar cells, perovskites, covalent organic frameworks, and other related applications of novel two/three‐dimensional materials.

I currently very interested in DFT-based multi-scale modeling for the understanding and design of new energy materials and developing machine learning approach for sustainable energy materials.
