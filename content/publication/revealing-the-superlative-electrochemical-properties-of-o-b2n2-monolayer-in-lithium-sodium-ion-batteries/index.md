abstract: Promising flexible electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs) are
  currently drawing considerable attention for their tremendous prospective
  end-use in portable self-powered electronic devices, including roll-up
  displays, and “smart” garments outfitted with piezoelectric patches to harvest
  energy from body movement. However, the lack of suitable battery electrodes
  that provides a specific electrochemical performance has made further
  development of these technologies challenging. Two-dimensional (2D)
  lightweight and flexible materials with outstanding physical and chemical
  properties, including mechanical strengths, hydrophilic surfaces, high surface
  metal diffusivity, and good conductivity, have been identified as a potential
  prospect for battery electrodes. In this study, taking a new 2D boron nitride
  allotrope, namely 2D orthorhombic diboron dinitride monolayer (o-B2N2) as
  representatives, we systematically explored several influencing factors,
  including electronic, mechanical, and their electrochemical properties (e.g.,
  binding strength, ionic mobility, equilibrium voltage, and theoretical
  capacity). Considering potential charge-transfer polarization, we employed a
  charged electrode model to simulate ionic mobility and found ionic mobility
  has a unique dependence on the surface atomic configuration influenced by bond
  length, valence electron number, electrical conductivity, excellent ionic
  mobility, low equilibrium voltage with excellent stability, good flexibility,
  and extremely superior theoretical capacity, up to 8.7 times higher than that
  of widely commercialized graphite (3239.74 mAh g−1 Vs 372 mAh g−1) in case of
  Li-ion batteries and 2159.83 mAh g−1 in case of Na-ion batteries, indicating
  that the new predicted 2D o-B2N2 monolayer possess the capability to be ideal
  flexible anode materials for Lithium and Sodium-ion battery. Our finding
  provides valuable insights for experimental explorations of flexible anode
  candidates based on 2D o-B2N2 monolayer.

summary: We have revealed for the first time the superlative electrochemical
  properties of 2D Boron Nitride as flexible anode for (Li,Na)-based ion
  batteries through several influencing factors based on the density functional
  theory calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. The binding
  strength, kinetics as well as the ionic-mobility of Li and Na intercalation
  were thoroughly evaluated. The finding indicates that the Li- and Na atoms can
  be stably inserted into B2N2 surface without clustering and tend to be
  preferably adsorbed at the B4N2-hollow site with a binding strength of about
  −1.408 and −0.569 eV, respectively. Additionally, the o-B2N2 provides
  outstanding electronic conductivity throughout the partial
  lithiation/sodiation process, a critical feature required for its application
  as a battery electrode. The high Li and Na storage capacity in both sides of
  o-B2N2 surface can achieve a very high-record theoretical specific capacity of
  about 3239.74 and 2159.83 mAh g−1, respectively. This represents a new
  superior record for Li-storage and significantly higher compared to many other
  2D materials for Na-storage. Also, these extremely high lithiated/sodiated
  exhibits good mechanical and thermal stability. Besides, the comparatively low
  open-circuit voltages of approximately 0.48 V (Li) and 0.33 V (Na) and
  Li/Na-ionic mobility of about 0.38 and 0.16 eV, respectively, provide a
  significant advantage in the high-performance Li- and Na-ion batteries. Based
  on the above remarkable electrochemical properties, it can be expected that 2D
  o-B2N2 offers a great prospect to be used as a new battery electrode for Li
  and Na ion batteries. Therefore, it is highly believed and hopefully, the
  present work can serve as a guideline for both computational and experimental
  discussions on the promising and versatile 2D anode materials.
