abstract: Development of high capacity anode materials is one of the essential
  strategies for next-generation high-performance Li/Na-ion batteries. Rational
  design, using density functional theory, can expedite the discovery of these
  anode materials. Here, we propose a new anode material, germanium carbide,
  g-GeC, for Li/Na-ion batteries. Our results show that g-GeC possesses both
  benefits of the high stability of graphene and the strong interaction between
  Li/Na and germanene. The single-layer germanium carbide, g-GeC, can be
  lithiated/sodiated on both sides yielding Li2GeC and Na2GeC with a storage
  capacity as high as 633 mA h/g. Besides germagraphene's 2D honeycomb
  structure, fast charge transfer, and high (Li/Na)-ion diffusion and negligible
  volume change further enhance the anode performance. These findings provide
  valuable insights into the electronic characteristics of newly predicted 2D
  g-GeC nanomaterial as a promising anode for (Li/Na)-ion batteries.
