Nabil Khossossi received his M.Sc degree in Mathematical Physics from the Department of Physics at Mohamed V university, Rabat in 2017. Then, he joined Material Physics and System Modeling laboratory at Department of Physics, Moulay Ismail University, Meknes, Morocco, as Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of Prof. Ismail Essaoudi & Prof. Abdelmajid Ainane. He is currently a visiting research student under the supervision of Prof. Rajeev Ahuja at Materials Theory Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University, Sweden. His PhD work focus on unifying energy harvesting through 2D materials modelling, including energy conversion and storage applications.

He is currently interested in DFT-based multi-scale modeling for the understanding and design of new energy materials and developing machine learning approach for 2D materials electrodes.

I will be looking for a post-doc position to start in 2021. Although I am primarily looking at positions in academic environments and research institutes, I am open to research-intensive environments with projects on the topics mentioned above. My academic CV is available upon request.
