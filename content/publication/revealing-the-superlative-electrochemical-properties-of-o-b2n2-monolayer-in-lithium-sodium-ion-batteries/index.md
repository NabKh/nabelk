abstract: Promising flexible electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs) are
  currently drawing considerable attention for their tremendous prospective
  end-use in portable self-powered electronic devices, including roll-up
  displays, and “smart” garments outfitted with piezoelectric patches to harvest
  energy from body movement. However, the lack of suitable battery electrodes
  that provides a specific electrochemical performance has made further
  development of these technologies challenging. Two-dimensional (2D)
  lightweight and flexible materials with outstanding physical and chemical
  properties, including mechanical strengths, hydrophilic surfaces, high surface
  metal diffusivity, and good conductivity, have been identified as a potential
  prospect for battery electrodes. In this study, taking a new 2D boron nitride
  allotrope, namely 2D orthorhombic diboron dinitride monolayer (o-B2N2) as
  representatives, we systematically explored several influencing factors,
  including electronic, mechanical, and their electrochemical properties (e.g.,
  binding strength, ionic mobility, equilibrium voltage, and theoretical
  capacity). Considering potential charge-transfer polarization, we employed a
  charged electrode model to simulate ionic mobility and found ionic mobility
  has a unique dependence on the surface atomic configuration influenced by bond
  length, valence electron number, electrical conductivity, excellent ionic
  mobility, low equilibrium voltage with excellent stability, good flexibility,
  and extremely superior theoretical capacity, up to 8.7 times higher than that
  of widely commercialized graphite (3239.74 mAh g−1 Vs 372 mAh g−1) in case of
  Li-ion batteries and 2159.83 mAh g−1 in case of Na-ion batteries, indicating
  that the new predicted 2D o-B2N2 monolayer possess the capability to be ideal
  flexible anode materials for Lithium and Sodium-ion battery. Our finding
  provides valuable insights for experimental explorations of flexible anode
  candidates based on 2D o-B2N2 monolayer.
